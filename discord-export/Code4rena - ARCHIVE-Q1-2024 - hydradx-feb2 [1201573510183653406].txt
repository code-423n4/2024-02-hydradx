[02/03/2024 11:36] cl0w
A tip for wardens: after creating a local fork of the mainnet chain using `chopsticks`, you can use our testnet UI and connect to your local RPC. You should be able to click around and make transactions using your mocked account

Just click in the bottom right corner where the block height is displayed

yes.substrate weight is basically how much the extrinsic takes of the total block weight. 

and from the weight , the tx fee is calculated - https://docs.substrate.io/reference/how-to-guides/weights/calculate-fees/

thanks , 
I want also to ask about the origin , what is it , I saw a detailed describtion about all the parameters but not the origin ?


[02/04/2024 20:49] ultimate_outsider
every extrinsic ( or dispatchable function )  must have origin

it indicates where the call came from.  substrate has 3 possible origin: Root, Signed(account) and None.  and then custom origins.

Is it possible for a user to get LRNA? @Martin @cl0w


[02/04/2024 21:07] ultimate_outsider
yes.  only when you remove liquidity, in some cases you can receive some lrna as compensation - depends on difference between current price and price when liquidity was added. 

check remove liquidity for details

perhaps one thing worth mentioning as it is not mentioned anywhere ( i think) and it is  not obvious unless you check runtime itself. 

~~you can send tokens directly to omnipool account except LRNA.  transferring lrna to omnipool account is explicitly filtered in the runtime. such transfers fail with CallFiltered error~~

update: you cannot send any tokens to omnipool account - all omnipools assets are filtered

[02/05/2024 19:06] theschnilch
With the `.into()` function, `state` (Type: AssetState) and `reserve` (Type: u128) are stored together in `reserve_state` (Type: AssetReserveState). How the `.into()` function casts the types AssetState and u128 in AssetReserveState is defined in the implementation of the `from()` function: https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-hydradx/blob/603187123a20e0cb8a7ea85c6a6d718429caad8d/HydraDX-node/pallets/omnipool/src/types.rs#L275C1-L289C2

Just to sanity check, have you `git pull`ed the latest master?


[02/06/2024 00:36] 0xtaylor
Also, do you have some alias set for `npx` that might be modifying your cmd?


[02/06/2024 00:38] 0xtaylor
Something else to check is that `$LOG_LEVEL` is not set


[02/06/2024 00:39] 0xtaylor
weird it's breaking on you there though becuase it should default to INFO if it can't unwrap the value https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks/blob/0d440a29d7046a6e3c8cb3c8bcd908f60a60b460/executor/src/lib.rs#L15-L16

I reinstalled chopsticks with the latest master and also checked that npx doesn't have an alias and that LOG_LEVEL is not set but I still get the same error. I also tried it with yarn but I get the same error


[02/07/2024 15:23] j4x_98
I'd have a question regarding the OOS definition in Runtime configuration. At the start it states "Wardens can assume that runtime is configured correctly and that pallets are configured correctly." while later on it states "However, findings on possible misconfiguration of pallets in scope will be considered." Which seems to contradict the earlier statement. 

Should we now assume that all pallet parameters are correctly configured or not?


[02/07/2024 15:30] 0xarsi
had the same question, which one is it lol


[02/07/2024 17:18] ultimate_outsider
what we really wanted to say is this 

you should take into account the runtime configuration when doiing your testing, because if you run pallet's tests - it does not use runtime configuration, it has a mock runtime.  You can find an issue when writing a test, but that might not work with runtime config. 

So, you should work with that configuration. 

however, if you find a possible exploit and the reason would be a problem in configuration, then yes, it is valid. 

we wanted to avoid  reports such as "If you change this parameter to this, it can be exploited in this way. And something should be done about that. Here is recommendation". 

hope it is clear.

Hello do the Stableswap and Omnipool pallets depend on each other, or could one of them be reviewed without looking into the other?


[02/09/2024 07:53] ultimate_outsider
they are standalone AMMs, they dont know about each other . You could use one or the other. 

What we do though, we add stable share token to the omnipool as another asset - so you can actually trade the stable share token with other omnipool token.  It is beneficial because we have on chain routing, so when you specify that you want to buy a stablecoiin such as egUSDC, whcih is in  stablepool only, and you want to trade it for eg DOT ( which is only in omnipool ) - you can call router's sell and it will do some dark magic and you receive USDC.  no need to go first to omnipool, trade DOT for something and then go to stablepool and trade it with desired USDC.

Thank you!


[02/13/2024 06:21] alix40
I have a general questions regarding substrate, so pallets in their config define some constants which are explicitly declared in `runtime/hydradx/src/assets.rs`, So basically if the protocol maintainers decide to change the value of a constant (e.g MinTradingLimit) they simply need to adjust the assets.rs file and redeploy the parachain ? or is it not possible anymore to change the value of constants ?


[02/13/2024 07:17] ultimate_outsider
It is so called upgrade. 

You can change whatever you want and upgrade your chain. 

However, if you don't have sudo/root access (which hydradx does not have)... Upgrade is governance action. That means such upgrade must be approved by majority of HDX holders.


[02/13/2024 10:25] alix40
Thanks for the answer! , i am  having trouble finding the Hydradx native token and the hubToken Implementations, is it possible to point them in the code, or at least how they are implemented? In solidity there is like smart contracts, here in substrate there are mainly pallets. I assume Each token would need its own pallet, with its own storage variables defined. Those pallets would in turn  expose functions, to be called by the accounts. Please also correct me if i am wrong


[02/13/2024 10:45] ultimate_outsider
It does not work here like you used to from evm world. 

Let me prepare an explanation..give me few mins.


[02/13/2024 10:48] alix40
much appreciated !


[02/13/2024 11:10] ultimate_outsider
Each parachain can choose how to want to internally represent an asset/token.

In HydraDX, we use simple u32 integer. So each token which we have on our chain has a unique identifier (u32 type).

Other chains can choose to do it different way - eg Acala ( next audit contest) uses an enum.

Then you choose how you want to manage your assets - what would keep the information abuot issuance, account balance, transfers, minting, burning etc.

You do this by choosing a pallet which is designed to handle this. Such pallets expose the functionality ( like you used from the token smart contract).
But here, one pallet takes care of all the assets ( instead of having a contract for each token).

In hydraDX:
For native asset -we use `pallet-balances`
for foreign assets we use `orml-tokens ` pallet

Each pallet exposes an interface that allows you to work with a token, and each function usually takes asset id as parameter. 
Eg. transfer function:
https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/blob/91942bcc134c5f073b3198d2eb9ebdec48d8547f/tokens/src/lib.rs#L490

In hydradx, to have a token that can be used on our chain - we require this token to be first registered in our asset registry. There we store additional information for each asset - such as symbol, decimals, existential deposit, origin location etc.


[02/13/2024 11:10] ultimate_outsider (pinned)
XCM - cross chain transfers
You probably heard that in polkadot you can send tokens between parachains. 
question you might be now asking is: how does that work ? since each chain can represent a token differently? how do they know ?

Every token which can be cross chain transferred has a unique identifier that determiens where is the origin of this token. 
EG.
`MultiLocation {
      parents: 1
      interior: {
        X2: [
          {
            Parachain: 2,026
          }
          {
            PalletInstance: 2
          }
        ]
      }
}`

this tells you that this token is on parachain 2026, identified by PalletInstance: 2 on their chain. 

So when you want to transfer some token amount from parachain A to parachain B - parachain A sends XCM message, saying something like:
*"Hey, this user wants to transfer token with this location and this amount to your chain".*

Parachain B receives this message, maps the location to its internal asset representation ( in our case, it would be the u32 type), and mints the amount to user's address.

TLDR: instead of each token having a smart contract, you have one pallet to handle each asset. You decided how you want to represent an asset in your chain.

one clarification. I got few questions why in the spec there is TVL cap check in add liquidity but it is not in the code.

the spec provided is as it was originally designed. however the tvl cap check was remove on 15th of november as it is no longer needed, weight cap of an asset is sufficient.

PR of tvl removal if interested: https://github.com/galacticcouncil/HydraDX-node/pull/697

Spec will be updated to reflect this change too.

Is there any resource on how these functions get called by user, in polkadot ecosystem?
cc: @Martin


[02/22/2024 17:04] ultimate_outsider
not clear what functions  you mean


[02/22/2024 17:38] qiuhaoli
Do you mean the "public/external" functions in EVM/solidity? They are "dispatchable functions" in polkadot, and you can find them in the impl of "#[pallet::call]" (those functions return `DispatchResult`).

Is HydraDX Council the AuthorityOrigin?


[02/23/2024 07:17] ultimate_outsider
You can check runtime config what It is set to

Not sure which you referring to, but I believe it is set to root
 
We usually have root, council or technical committee as possible special origins


[02/25/2024 01:15] deki04
is there a way to 'run' this code? Or is it only interactable via the tests?


[02/25/2024 06:09] ultimate_outsider
You can run a node locally and Interact with it via a web interface

Is the council not behind any origin role ? Is there any governance to execute changes to the code or is that the autority which is the root of the parachain ?


[02/25/2024 10:46] ultimate_outsider
no, council is just another possible origin that you can execute extrinsics with. 

Code changes can be executed only with root origin.  Since in HydraDx, we  dont have sudo module ( module where you can set one account to act as root origin),  authorize upgrade extrinsic must go through democracy, meaning that such proposal must be approved first.

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[02/25/2024 12:36] minh___
How or where is the root set?

I was able to find out where the origin is checked to be root:

```rs
    fn try_origin(o: O) -> Result<Self::Success, O> {
        o.into().and_then(|o| match o {
            RawOrigin::Root => Ok(()),
            r => Err(O::from(r)),
        })
    }
```

But I cant figure out how it is determined when origin is the RawOrigin::Root variant


[02/25/2024 15:07] ultimate_outsider
it is not set. you have certain mechanism which can dispatch a call with root origin.   so you have to use of those. 

As I mentioned previously, one of the easiest way is to use sudo pallet.  With this pallet, you can choose an account that can act as root and dispatch calls with root orgiin. 

here: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/de6d02591b57d03f70ed8db0c674f045ad2ea029/substrate/frame/sudo/src/lib.rs#L207

but this is only useful, ege in development. Using this pallet, it is not decentralised and you give lot of power to one account. So whoever owns it, can do anything. 

In HydraDX, obviously we dont have  this pallet. Note that if you had a running parachain, and wanted to interact with other chains, and you still had sudo access on your chain - HydraDX and most of other parachain would not allow it until you remove the sudo access.

So, now , question you have: how else I can dispatch as root ? 

again as mentioned,  through democracy. 

https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/de6d02591b57d03f70ed8db0c674f045ad2ea029/substrate/frame/democracy/src/lib.rs#L1611

if you look how this pallet works , you 'd understand. but briefly - you propose something , referendum happens, token holders vote, and if approved, it is executed = with ROOT origin.

@Martin curious what setup/IDE you usually work with?  VsCode + RustAnalyzer seems to have trouble with the Substrate Framework, specifically finding references


[02/26/2024 12:04] ultimate_outsider
substrate is heavy for everything .and because it uses lots of macros and traits - sometimes it is hard for any ide to find what you want to see.  i dont use vscode, but many epople do, so it should be fine, 

what specifically you find hard to find ?


[02/26/2024 12:32] minh___
Had different issues, but 2 examples:

```rs
impl pallet_omnipool::Config for Runtime {
    type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
    type AssetId = AssetId;
    type Currency = Currencies;
```

Here I cant jump to the type declarations, e.g. where `Currencies` is defined. Eventually I figured out by using global search that its in runtime/[...]/lib.rs :

```rs
Currencies: pallet_currencies = 79,
```

And here I was trying to jump to the declaration of `pallet_currencies`. I do of course understand that this refers to the `currencies` pallet/library, its just that navigation isnt working for me. For now I can wrap my head around it somehow, was just hoping that maybe there was some setup with a better experience


[02/26/2024 12:37] ultimate_outsider
this is all macros, thats why. Currencies are created by a macro.  

my ide works fine with your second example - i can jump to pallet_currencies from there.

{Reactions}
üëç 

[02/26/2024 12:43] minh___
interesting, only works for me if go to another occurrence, such as:

`use pallet_currencies::BasicCurrencyAdapter;`

[02/27/2024 21:16] ultimate_outsider
what  you mean by call to the protocol account ? 

if you mean "transfer to protocol account" - this has to be done manually before calling add token .


[02/27/2024 21:18] acegawd
Yes a transfer to the protocol account but done manually how?

Congratulations! @castle_chain, this is my first attempt to audit and I have learned a lot from your tweet. Also, I wonder is there a way to review other's submissions before the report is published?
